# Notes on our CI:
# - Tests located test configuration annotated modules nested in the module
#   being tested.
# - Nightly rust used for support of the box keyword. Syntax is nicer, and 
#   directly allocates to heap.
# - Compiler Release is commented out to reduce pipeline time before release 
#   intention. This will be allowed to run at a later point.
